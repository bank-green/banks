# Fair Finance Notes

* The end result spreadsheet should indicate which fairfinance guides a bank came from (so 10 new columns)
* Website will not be available for fairfinance banks righ now. That data will be merged to the CSV sheet later on.
* Bank tags will need to be autogenerated and should not contain special characters or even accent marks. There is a helper function in the notebook for this.
* Rating Guidelines 100 - 80: Great, <80 - 60: ok, <60-40: bad, <40: worst
